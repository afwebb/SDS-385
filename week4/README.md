This is after running over all the files once. Clearly that wasn't necessary. I'll try to add back in a convergence condition.

Running takes about 2 minutes, which I'm sure can improve. My batch sizes are fairly large, and I'm running through files sequentially.

Also still need to write up some more and add comments to the code.
